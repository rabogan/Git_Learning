Helping me to get the hang of this version control system!

Initially, I was rather unwisely using Github just as a place to upload projects to show them off, and wasn't really aware of how useful version control can be, potentially.
Now, I'm starting the processes, including:
1)  Creating an open source repository, with the intention to allow edits, test new ideas, and be able to roll them back if necessary.
2)  Starting and managing NEW branches.
3)  Changing a file within those branches, and then using "commit" to commit these changes to Github.
4)  Opening and merging a PULL REQUEST
